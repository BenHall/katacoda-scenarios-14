In this step you will be creating your cellery project. 
`cellery init`{{execute}} 
Execute above command to initialize your project. 
You will be getting  a prompt for your project name. 
Enter `hello-world`{{execute}} as the project name. 
It will create a folder for your project. Switch in to the newly created project
`cd hello-world`{{execute}}
Cellery will automatically generate a hello world cell file for you. Since this is a hello world scenario, we can use the auto generated cell file.

This scenario simply deploys a static Hello world web page written by HTML.

You can examine cell that was created. It is kinda self explanatory however in next step we will be learning about each field detailed.
