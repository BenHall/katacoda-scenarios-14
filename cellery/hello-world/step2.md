## Initializing the project

In this step you will be creating your cellery project. 
Type `cellery init`{{execute}} in your terminal to initialize your project. You will be getting  a prompt for your project name. Enter `hello-world`{{execute}} as the project name. It will create a folder for your project. You can switch in to that directory using `cd hello-world`{{execute}}. Cellery will automatically generate a hello world cell file for you. Since this is a hello world scenario, we can use that cell file.

You can examine cell that was created. It is kinda self self explanatory however in next step we will be learning about each field detailed.
