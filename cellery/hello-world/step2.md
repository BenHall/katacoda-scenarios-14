In this step you will be creating your cellery project.

You can initialize your cellery project with the following command.  
`cellery init`{{execute}}

Enter your project name in the terminal  
`hello-world`{{execute}}

It will create a folder for your project. Switch in to the newly created project  
`cd tutorial/hello-world`{{execute}}

Cellery will automatically generate a hello world cell file for you.

Since this is a hello world scenario, we can use the auto generated cell file.

This hello world cell simply deploys a static Hello world web page written by HTML.

You can examine cell that was created from the editor. 

It is kinda self explanatory however in next step we will be learning about each field detailed.
