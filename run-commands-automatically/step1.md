## Preparing the enviroment.

Cellery installation will start automatically. This can take several miniutes.
This installs a Kuberentes runtime, Cellery Runtime (Dev setup) and Cellery CLI.
Please wait for katacoda to finish cellery installation.

Once everything is done, run `cellery version`{{execute}} to check if everything is working properly.

## Configuring the cluster

Type `cellery setup`{{execute}} to configure your cluster.
Since we have a preconfigured cellery runtime here, Select `Select from existing cluster` and select your cluster.

Congradlations.! You have sucessfully configured cellery. 

You will deploy a hello world cell in next step.
